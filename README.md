# Stock-Market-# Stock Data Pipeline and Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data pipeline for stock market data utilizing AWS, Python, Kafka, MySQL, and Flask. The system is designed to ingest, process, and analyze stock market data, ultimately producing valuable insights and reports. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the project's architecture and components:

## Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion and Storage:**
   - Stock market data is initially stored in AWS. The data is accessed and simulated for processing.

2. **Data Streaming:**
   - Data is streamed from AWS to Apache Kafka for real-time processing.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - The streamed data is consumed and processed using Python. Predictive analysis is performed using various regression models.

4. **Data Storage and Reporting:**
   - Processed data is appended to a MySQL database via Kafka connectors. Reports and visualizations are generated using Power BI.

5. **User Interface:**
   - A Flask-based frontend provides an interactive user interface for easy access and visualization of the data and analysis results.

## Components

### 1. AWS
- **Role:** Data storage and simulation environment.
- **Details:** Stock market data is stored in AWS services and used for simulation and data ingestion.

### 2. Apache Kafka
- **Role:** Data streaming and message brokering.
- **Details:** Kafka is used to stream data from AWS to a processing pipeline, ensuring real-time data handling.

### 3. Python
- **Role:** Data processing and predictive analysis.
- **Details:** 
  - **Data Frame:** Data is loaded into a Python DataFrame for analysis.
  - **Predictive Models:** Linear Regression, AdaBoost Regression, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are applied to forecast stock trends.

### 4. MySQL
- **Role:** Data storage for reporting.
- **Details:** Kafka connectors append processed data to a MySQL database, which is then used for generating reports.

### 5. Power BI
- **Role:** Reporting and data visualization.
- **Details:** Reports and dashboards are created using Power BI to visualize stock trends and analytics.

### 6. Flask
- **Role:** Frontend interface.
- **Details:** A Flask application provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the system, visualizing data, and accessing analysis results.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Apache Kafka
- MySQL
- AWS Account
- Power BI
- Flask
- Relevant Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, keras, sqlalchemy)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock-data-pipeline.git
   cd stock-data-pipeline
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS and Kafka:**
   - Set up AWS credentials and Kafka broker configurations as per the project requirements.

4. **Setup MySQL:**
   - Create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the project settings.

5. **Run Kafka Broker:**
   - Start the Kafka broker and create necessary topics for data streaming.

6. **Run Flask Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Generate Reports in Power BI:**
   - Connect Power BI to the MySQL database and create the necessary reports and dashboards.

## Usage

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Simulate data ingestion from AWS and observe real-time streaming through Kafka.

2. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Access the Python scripts for running linear regression, AdaBoost regression, and LSTM models.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Monitor data insertion into the MySQL database and ensure data integrity.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Use Power BI to generate and view reports based on the data stored in MySQL.

5. **Frontend Interface:**
   - Interact with the Flask-based web application for visualizing data and analysis results.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues:**
  - Ensure all services (AWS, Kafka, MySQL) are running and properly configured.
  
- **Data Streaming Problems:**
  - Check Kafka logs for errors and verify topic configurations.

- **Predictive Model Errors:**
  - Verify data formats and ensure all necessary libraries are correctly installed.
